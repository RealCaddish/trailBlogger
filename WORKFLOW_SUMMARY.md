# Trail Blogger Backup/Restore Workflow - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## What's Fixed

### ‚úÖ Data Issues Resolved
- **Removed 6 trails** without GPS coordinates (placeholders and empty trails)
- **Calculated lengths** for all 8 remaining trails from GPS coordinates
- **Fixed image paths** to use filename-only format
- **Total:** 8 trails, 44.95 miles, 18 images across 3 trails

### ‚úÖ Complete Backup System Created
You now have a **seamless backup/restore workflow** that includes:

1. **`complete_backup.py`** - Creates full backup with:
   - `trails_backup.geojson` - All trail data with metadata
   - `trail_images.zip` - All images (14 MB)
   - `README.md` - Restore instructions
   - Everything timestamped and organized

2. **`complete_restore.py`** - Interactive restore that:
   - Lists all available backups
   - Shows metadata before restoring
   - Creates safety backups
   - Restores both data and images

3. **`BACKUP_RESTORE_GUIDE.md`** - Complete documentation with:
   - Quick reference commands
   - Detailed workflows
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Technical details

### ‚úÖ Image Path System Verified
- Images stored as **filenames only** in `trails.geojson`
- Physical files in `data/trail_images/trail-<id>/`
- Frontend constructs full paths automatically
- **Works on both localhost AND GitHub Pages!**

# 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
python deploy.py

# 4. Wait 2 minutes, then check: https://realcaddish.github.io/trailBlogger/
```

### When You Need to Restore

## Data Management Menu (In Browser)

When using the Trail Blogger web interface at localhost:5000:

**Option 2: Restore from Backup**
- Upload a `trails_backup.geojson` file
- Now supports the new v2.0 format with metadata
- Backwards compatible with old formats

**Option 7: Backup Trail Images**
- Creates a JSON backup of images
- But **we recommend using `python complete_backup.py` instead**
- It creates a proper ZIP file with better organization
