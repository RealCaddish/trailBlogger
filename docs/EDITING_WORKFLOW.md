# Trail Blogger Editing Workflow

##  Design Philosophy

**Localhost = Edit & Save**  
**GitHub Pages = Read-Only Display**

This is the proper way to use static site hosting like GitHub Pages!

---

##  Where You Can Edit

###  localhost:5000 (Full Editing)

**What you can do:**
-  Add new trails
-  Edit trail details (name, length, difficulty, dates, descriptions)
-  Upload images
-  Change trail status (hiked ↔ unhiked)
-  Delete trails
-  Manage data (backups, restore)
-  All changes are SAVED to disk

**How to access:**
```bash
python server.py
```
Then visit: http://localhost:5000

---

###  GitHub Pages (Read-Only)

**What you can do:**
-  View all trails
-  See trail details, images, descriptions, dates
-  Browse the map
-  Filter by hiked/unhiked
-  Share with others

**What you CANNOT do:**
-  Add trails
-  Edit trails
-  Change trail status
-  Upload images
-  Delete trails

**Why?** GitHub Pages is a static file server - it has no database or backend to save changes.

**Live site:** https://realcaddish.github.io/trailBlogger/

##  Your Workflow

### Making Changes

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start Flask Server] --> B[localhost:5000]
    B --> C[Make Edits]
    C --> D[Changes Saved to Disk]
    D --> E[python deploy.py]
    E --> F[GitHub Pages Updated]
    F --> G[Wait 2 Minutes]
    G --> H[See Changes Live!]
```

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Start Flask Server**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Edit on localhost:5000**
   - Add new trails
   - Update existing trails
   - Change hiked/unhiked status
   - Add/edit descriptions and dates
   - Upload images
   
   ** All changes automatically save to `data/trails.geojson`**

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   ```bash
   python deploy.py
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Validate your data
   - Create a backup
   - Commit changes to git
   - Push to GitHub
   - GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically

4. **Wait 2 Minutes**
   - GitHub Pages takes ~2 minutes to rebuild
   - Then your changes are live!

5. **Verify**
   - Visit https://realcaddish.github.io/trailBlogger/
   - Check your changes are there

##  Trail Status Management

### Changing Status (Hiked ↔ Unhiked)

**On localhost:5000:**

1. Click on a trail
2. Click "Edit"
3. Change the "Status" dropdown:
   - **Hiked** → Trail appears in "Hiked" filter
   - **Unhiked** → Trail appears in "Unhiked" filter
4. Click "Save"
5. Status is immediately updated and saved to disk

**Then deploy:**
```bash
python deploy.py
```

**Result:**
- Trails automatically sorted by status on GitHub Pages
- "Hiked" filter shows only hiked trails
- "Unhiked" filter shows only unhiked trails
- Status persists across deployments

---

##  What Happens If Someone Edits on GitHub Pages?

**Short answer: Nothing is saved.**

1. User makes changes in their browser
2. Changes are stored in browser memory only
3. User refreshes page → changes are lost
4. No changes are saved to the server
5. No one else sees the changes

**That's why we disabled editing on GitHub Pages!**

---

##  Backup Strategy

### Automatic Backups

Every time you run `python deploy.py`, an automatic backup is created.

### Manual Backups

Before making major changes:

```bash
python complete_backup.py
```

This creates a timestamped backup in `backups/` with:
- `trails_backup.geojson` - All trail data
- `trail_images.zip` - All images
- `README.md` - Restore instructions

### Restoring from Backup

```bash
python complete_restore.py
```

This will:
1. List all available backups
2. Let you select one
3. Restore trails and images
4. Create safety backup of current data first

##  FAQ

**Q: Can I add a trail directly on GitHub Pages?**  
A: No. You must add trails on localhost:5000, then deploy.

**Q: What if I change a trail status on the live site?**  
A: The change will be lost when you refresh the page. It's not saved.

**Q: How do I share my trails with others?**  
A: Just share the GitHub Pages URL: https://realcaddish.github.io/trailBlogger/

**Q: Do my friends need to run the Flask server?**  
A: No! They just visit your GitHub Pages site. Only YOU need Flask for editing.

**Q: What if I forget to deploy after editing?**  
A: Your changes are safe on your computer in `data/trails.geojson`, but they won't show on the live site until you run `python deploy.py`.

**Q: Can I edit on my phone?**  
A: Not easily. Flask runs on your computer. You'd need to edit files directly or use a cloud IDE.

##  Summary

**Your workflow is now:**

1.  **Edit** on localhost:5000 (Flask)
2.  **Save** (automatic when you click "Save" in the UI)
3.  **Deploy** with `python deploy.py`
4. ⏱ **Wait** 2 minutes
5.  **Live** on GitHub Pages!

Simple, safe, and effective!
