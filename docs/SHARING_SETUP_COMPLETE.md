4. **Trail locations** - Exact coordinates are visible
5. **Hiking dates** - When you hiked is public information

### Before Pushing:

## 🔄 Reverting to Private (If Needed)

If you change your mind and want to go back to private:

1. **Re-add gitignore rules:**
```gitignore
# Add back to .gitignore
data/trail_images/*/
```

2. **Remove from Git history:**
```bash
git rm -r --cached data/trail_images/trail-*/
git commit -m "Remove trail images from tracking"
git push origin main
```

3. **Optional: Clean Git history** (removes images completely)
```bash
# WARNING: Rewrites history - use with caution
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf data/trail_images/trail-*' HEAD
git push origin main --force
```
