## 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Image Upload 405 Error
**Status:** Complete

**Changes:**
- Updated `server.py` to handle both POST and OPTIONS requests for image uploads

  - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS`
- This fixes the "405 Method Not Allowed" error

**Root Cause:** The server wasn't handling CORS preflight OPTIONS requests, causing the browser to block the POST request.

**Important Note:** Make sure to run the Python server with:
```bash
python server.py
```
Then access the app at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Starting the Application:**
   ```bash
   # Start the Python server
   python server.py
   
   # Open in browser
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

2. **First Time Users:**
   - Click the "About" button to see the welcome guide
   - Follow the "Getting Started" instructions

3. **Adding a Trail:**

   - Upload a GeoJSON file or enter trail details manually
   - Add photos (up to 10 images, 10MB each)

4. **Managing Trails:**

### For Developers

**Image Upload Fix:**
The 405 error was caused by missing CORS preflight handling. The fix ensures:
- Browser sends OPTIONS request first (preflight)
- Server responds with allowed methods and headers
- Browser then sends actual POST request with images

**Delete Functionality:**
```javascript
// Full cleanup on delete:
1. Remove from this.trails array
2. Delete images from server via API
3. Update localStorage
4. Update GeoJSON in localStorage
5. Refresh UI (map, list, stats)
6. Close description panel if needed
```

**Image Backup Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T...",
  "version": "1.0",
  "trails": [
    {
      "trailId": 1234567890,
      "trailName": "Example Trail",
      "images": [
        {
          "filename": "image1.jpg",
          "size": 123456,
          "url": "/api/trails/1234567890/images/image1.jpg"
