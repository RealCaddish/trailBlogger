# Verify .gitignore is working
git status --ignored
```

### Test Fresh Clone
```bash
# Clone to new location
git clone <repository-url> test-clone
cd test-clone

# Check for personal data
ls -la data/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No data directory (good!)"
find . -name "*.json" -exec grep -l "personal" {} \; 2>/dev/null || echo "No personal data found (good!)"
